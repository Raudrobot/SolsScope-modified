# SolsRNGBot Server Edition
## This is a variant of the SolsRNGBot macro designed for people who have to Macro in a Glitch Hunt server.

# Features:
- Biome Detection
- Auto Craft Mode (for afking)
- Merchant Detection (if autocraft is off)
- Sending to a webhook
- Specific Role Pings for Mari/Jester
- Sending a screenshot of a Merchant's stock upon detection

# Note that this version is very minimal compared to the full version of SolsRNGBot.
# Setup:
## In order to setup the Macro, you need to install the requirements (py -m pip install -r requirements.txt) or (py -m pip install discord==1.7.3 pyautogui pynput requests pillow screeninfo mousekey psutil).

Once you are done, press save and start macro to begin.
