# Features:

- Sending of Discord Messages to server
- Custom Plugins to add custom commands
- Automatic Updating of New Auras
- Mention on aura roll
- Minimum rarity for ping and send message
- Compatibility with all kinds of monitor sizes

# TBA:
- Create a feature request if you want something to be added!

# How to use:
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/bazthedev/SolsRNGBot/releases/latest)
2. Install the requirements by running `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main.py file
4. Edit the newly created `settings.json` file and paste your discord bot token in the "TOKEN" key.
5. Run the main.py file again
6. Add the bot to a server
7. Run the set_log_channel command in the channel you want the bot to automatically post in
8. And you are done! You can customize the settings by editing the `settings.json` file or by using some of the built in commands.

# Common Issues:
- Chromatic is bugged, due to the amount of different colours there is only a very small chance that it will detect the Chromatic cutscene.
- If you recently updated and you receive errors relating to `settings.json`, then copy the important keys, like TOKEN and log_channel_id, and delete the `settings.json` file. The program will automatically create a new file using the most up to date settings.
## If you are experiencing issues, please create a new issue so that it can be raised, solved and prevented from happening again.
